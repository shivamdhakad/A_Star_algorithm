To run this file do the following: 
1) Press Run or type a_star_shivam_modabbir.py in the terminal 
2) Inputs given: \
Clearance - 5 \
Radius - 2 \
Robot Step size - 2 \
X- coordinate of start node - 10 \
Y - coordinate of start node - 10 \
Orientation of the robot at initial point - 30 \
X- coordinate of goal node - 1150 \
Y - coordinate of goal node - 30 \
Orientation of the robot at final point - 30 

Output: There will be 2 plots and videos generated once you the run the code. 
First plot will be the visualization of node exploration which will generate a plot of the node exploration and will save a video file named 'node_exploration_animation.mp4' .
Once the node exploration visualization is completed, you will have to close the plot in order to visualize the path exploration which will generate a similar plot as earlier and save video file named 'optimal_path_animation.mp4'.

Note: Don't forget to close the plot of node exploration visualization so that the optimal path visualization pops up.
